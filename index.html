    <p>The path to success can make us feel as though we’re being beaten, especially if the path comes with failures.

        In reality, the only thing that can have us beat is giving up. We can stand to learn something from our failures, and when we don’t give up, they instead become stepping stones to future success.</p>

    <div> <p>Doing hard things can make us want to give up, but sometimes doing hard things can make achieving our goals feel better, as we know we’ve put in hard work to get there.</p></div>

        Being okay with not knowing what your next step is and allowing yourself to simply be on the journey can be hard, but it pays off and helps us learn more about ourselves.
        Sometimes we base our success and progress on the success and progress that others make, but doing this can hold us back. We’re better served by believing in ourselves and basing our ideas of success on ourselves because, if we believe we can, we will.</P>
